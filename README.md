# Original work
The original work is included in the zip file, it includes the original experiments as captured by the people at Smartlab

# Modifications
From that work, the script described in run_analysis.R was run. A codebook describing it is included.
Analysis run is:
 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
