# Datasets
When the script finishes, 2 important datasets will be saved to memory:

## dataset
The original set consisting of the training and testing set (included also), with apropiately named columns, activity and subject code
#### CodeBook included in zip file
## relevant
The relevant information to be included, summarizing based on activity and subject the mean and standard deviation of several readings
### columns included in the relevant dataset are:
